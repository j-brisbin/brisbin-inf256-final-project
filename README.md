# brisbin-inf256-final-project
This was a final project created for a Server Side Scripting course (INF 256). This final project consists of a forum where users can create posts and comment on them for given topics. This demonstrates the PHP concepts of MVC as well as connecting to a database.
This project recently had its Front End changed to utilize Polymer as an experiment. Polymer is licensed under the MIT license. 
This project also utilizes Bower to manage the related dependencies for Polymer. Bower is licensed under the MIT license.

Due to the nature of this project, a Database will need to be set up. This project is set up to use MySQL using mysqli however, using PDO can allow for this project to be used with other databases. 
You can learn more on the differences between mysqli and PDO through the PHP Documentation (http://php.net/docs.php)
If you wish to use MySQL, I recommend using the MySQL Workbench available from Oracle's website (https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/).
